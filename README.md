TODO : 
  - [X] Debug duration not working with videos
  - [X] Gif not working
  - [X] File with same name not working
  - [X] Video sometimes plays 2 times
  - [ ] Linux implementation for server
  - [ ] SignalR implementation (.NET Realtime Web Page Library)
  - [ ] Skip command => Using SignalR
  - [ ] Add links to youtube and twitter videos => Download and play directly, API is a paid one, so scraping it is
  - [ ] Make videos bigger when to small / portrait mode (Maybe option to do so)
  - [ ] Normalize sound
